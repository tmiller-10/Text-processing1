```
 âœ¨ Let's characterize the file and its words!

The input file contains 23 lines, including blank lines!
The input file contains 19 lines, not including blank lines!
The input file contains 5 paragraphs!
The input file contains 118 unique words across all sets!
The words that are found across all sets are: {'Make', 'to'}
