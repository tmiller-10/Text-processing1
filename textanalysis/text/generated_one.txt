It's hard to believe that someone like Ryan Lochte, who did not have a serious water-related incident, would have been in such a position to take the lead in this kind of scandal.

The Lochte hoax was carried out on a private website in March. The website was called "Oceans," and it contained a photograph of Lochte with a water bottle. It was claimed to be from the Lochte family.

The photo was taken on June 27, 2016. According to the website, Lochte told the Guardian that, "I couldn't help but feel, 'Oh my God, what a miracle!'" It was reported that Lochte never had a health issue.

But there was a problem with that. The Lochte family had filed a lawsuit against the website for defamation. The court ruled that the photograph was not authentic.

The lawsuit was dismissed on September 25th, 2017.

It didn't last long. The Lochte family filed a lawsuit against the website for defamation, which was then dismissed on October 1, 2017.

It took nearly two years for the lawsuit to be dismissed.

Unfortunately, that means that there is no way to tell who is talking about the Lochte hoax.
