These Songs all have in common is that they were recorded at the same studio.They were recorded at Sun Studio which is located in Memphis, Tennessee.
 It was formerly known as Memphis Recording Service and
 was housed in the same building as the Sun Records label business.

 The 1933 Version gives a sense of how musicals were back in that time frame. 
 This tends to be something on how you look and see what the dances were like for much older musicals. 
 To me it was interesting to see how the newer one has a little more intense movements compared to the older version.

The first one is the White Christmas version that you hear on the radio during the holiday season. 
Itâ€™s such a staple and everyone loves it. It has good rhythm and good tempo. 
The White Christmas version with Michael Buble is a new and inviting tune as it implements new age music to such a holiday classic. 
Personally, when listening to this song while writing this, it was hard to not like jam out to such a classic of a song but with Michael Buble.

In this song Rock Island Line, It clearly uses the call and response technique that we discussed in class. 
This also sounds like a work song that the slaves would sing. 
The song is sung with the intention being a work song and how it is repeated on and off again the same saying over and over again.

This song really gives the feel of the european Medieval time period as it has it has various instruments in the background and has one person singing and then a few more people join in. 
To me it sounds like it could be a church song . While this song is long it could be like a long church song. 
This is also a very calming song to overall listen to.
