The Federal Reserve has been trying to figure out how much money will be available to the economy of the United States from the Federal Reserve, although the Fed is pushing back its efforts.

The Federal Reserve Board is pushing back on the idea that the U.S. economy has reached a point where it is no longer "in an economy of money," according to a report released by the Fed last week.

The report, titled "The American Economy: The Federal Reserve Is Making a Mistake," points to a few key facts.

The Fed has no plans to raise interest rates.

"In fact, the Federal Reserve expects to raise rates before the next set of economic growth rates are set and before the next monetary policy cycle begins," the report said.

The Fed didn't make any specific announcement about how much money will be available to the economy in the report, which was released just before the third quarter in which the government's unemployment rate was at its lowest level in more than a decade.

But it did say that if policymakers are willing to raise rates, "there is no reason to expect that the monetary policy rate will be substantially lower than at present."
